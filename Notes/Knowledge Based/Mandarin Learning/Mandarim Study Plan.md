# Mandarin Study Plan
## Beginner Level - HSK-1
* **Goal**: discover the language system and prepare the basic learning tools.
### Pinyin & Hanzi
* Hanzi:
	* The Chinese characters used in written Mandarin;
	* They are pictographic and ideographic symbols that represent words or concepts;
	* They are essential for reading and writing in Mandarin;
	* We use simplified Hanzi in mainland China and Traditional Hanzi in Hong Kong, Taiwan or other Chinese speaking regions.
* Pinyin:
	* A system for representing Mandarin pronunciation using the Latin alphabet;
	* It uses letters and diacritical marks to indicate the four tones, as well as the specific sounds of Mandarin phonemes;
	* Often used as a teaching tool for non-native speakers, as it provides a more accessible way to learn pronunciation and tone before tackling the comples characters of Hanzi.
* The most important thing when you study Chinese is setting the foundations for pronunciation and tones right

## First Week

* Focus on tones and pinyin;
* Get familiar with the sounds of the language
*  Try listening to these videos during the week and pause and actively practise along with it, repeat each sound out loud until you feel comfortable with the pronunciation:

	* [Learn Chinese Alphabet Pinyin (20 minutes) | Beginner Chinese Pronunciation Lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pgOn61fCyw)
* During this period, focus on Pinyin!!!

## Second & Third Week

In the Chinese writing system, a radical is a graphical component of a character that gives it its meaning and helps in the classification and indexing of the character. They are often known as "keys" or "clues" and often indicate the semantic category of the character. There are a total of 214 radicals in the Chinese writing system, which are used to classify and organize the characters in dictionaries and other reference material. By recognizing and understanding the radical of a character, one can more easily learn and remember new characters that are related in meaning.

* Start learning onl the most common radicals, which number around 55;
* At this level, focus on understanding what each radical represents;
* This will take around two weeks to complete, and you'll be studying a couple of raficals everyday through writing;
* Try finding corresponding Hanzi with each radical, focusing on the function of the radical;
* It's essential to train how you picture a character from the beginning;
* To practice writing, whether it's Hanzi or radicals, you can use TOFULearning, which offers many writing practice sets for each level;
* TIP: always add the Pinyin when you write down a radical or a word. It's a good habit to get used to reading Pinyin while writing any characters.
* The PLECO dictionary can help you break down every character into the basic components. If you have more budget, there is a paid dictionary called Han Book which is also great.
* **Continue practicing tones and pronuntiation in this phase!**

## HSK-1

Now we have the basic concepts about the language and have prepared the basic tools. In this level you can expect to understand and use simple words and phrases. This is a beginner level, with only 150 words. It is estimated to complete this level in 15 days (having the time, of course). Everyday you'll be requested to study 10 new characters. If you prefer to study with a structured book, the HSK books will be the best option. Where you have the words list, conversation, grammar points and detailed explanantions.
