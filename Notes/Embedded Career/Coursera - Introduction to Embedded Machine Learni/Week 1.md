# Week 1

## What is Machine Learning

### Human Intelligence

* Solve problems
* Achieve goals
* Analyze and Reason
* Communicate, collaborate & influence
* Consciousness, Emotions, Intuition, Imagination

### Artificial Intelligence

* The ability for machines to simulate & enhance human intelligence
* The designing and building of intelligent agents that receive precepts from the environment and take actions that affect that environment - Stuart Russel & Peter Norvig.

## Machine Learning is a subfield of AI


## Limitations and Ethics

## Trust in Humans

* Morals & Ethics
* Character
* Societal Laws
* Cultural Laws
* Compassion
* ...

## Trust in AI

* They must be made:
	* lawful
	* Robust
	* Ethical

### Requirements of Trustworthy AI

* Human agency & oversight
* Technical robustness & safety
* Privacy & data governance
* Transparency
* Diversity, fairness & non-discrimination
* Societal & environmental wellbeing
* Accountability

## What is TinyML and what it is used for?

* On-device machine learning applications in the single `mW` range and below.
* Classifications in the order of computational requirements (low to high - descending)
	* Vibration & Motion
	* Voice & Sound
	* Vision

## Machine Learning on Microcontrollers

While optional, we encourage you to take a look at the following articles to learn more about the topics covered in this lesson:

* [TinyML: Making Smart Devices Tinier than Ever](https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/resources/tinyml-making-smart-devices-tinier-ever/)

[Signal processing is key to embedded Machine Learning](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/blog/dsp-key-embedded-ml). This article is a bit advanced, as it includes topics we have not covered yet. However, I recommend checking it out if you're curious to see how digital signal processing (DSP) complements embedded machine learning.

Edge Impulse has its own academic paper that was written in collaboration with some researchers from Harvard SEAS. It details many of the challenges in embedded machine learning and how Edge Impulse tackles those issues. I recommend at least reading the abstract here:[https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03332](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/blog/dsp-key-embedded-ml).

If you are working on a research project or academic paper that uses Edge Impulse, we'd love to have you cite our paper!

If you'd like to learn more about AI accelerators, including various processor architectures intended to optimize machine learning algorithms, I highly recommend checking out the following articles:

* [What Makes a Good AI Accelerator](https://semiengineering.com/what-makes-a-good-accelerator/)
* [How to Make Your Own Deep Learning Accelerator Chip](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-make-your-own-deep-learning-accelerator-chip-1ff69b78ece4)
* [DNN Accelerator Architecture - SIMD or Systolic?](https://www.sigarch.org/dnn-accelerator-architecture-simd-or-systolic/)

## What makes a Good Dataset

While optional, we encourage you to take a look at the following articles to learn more about the topics covered in this lesson:
* [About Train, Validation and Test Sets in Machine Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/train-validation-and-test-sets-72cb40cba9e7)
* [What Is Balanced And Imbalanced Dataset?](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/what-is-balance-and-imbalance-dataset-89e8d7f46bc5)
* [How to Build A Data Set For Your Machine Learning Project](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-data-set-for-your-machine-learning-project-5b3b871881ac)
* [Impact of Dataset Size on Deep Learning Model Skill And Performance Estimates](https://machinelearningmastery.com/impact-of-dataset-size-on-deep-learning-model-skill-and-performance-estimates/)
* [Best practices for creating training data](https://cloud.google.com/automl-tables/docs/data-best-practices)

Edge Impulse pre-built dataset: [Continuous Gestures](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/continuous-gestures). Feel free to use this pre-built gesture set if you do not want to or cannot collect your own gesture data. Please note that the gestures in this set are slightly different from the gestures performed in the previous lesson.

Many machine learning students and practitioners like to start with pre-built datasets. Many of the popular datasets can be found in [this listing](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/best-datasets-for-machine-learning-data-science-computer-vision-nlp-ai-c9541058cf4f). However, note that most of these datasets are not configured for use with smaller machine learning applications, such as those intended for microcontrollers.

## Feature Selection and Extraction

Invidual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed.

While optional, we encourage you to take a look at the following articles and videos to learn more about the topics covered in this lesson:

* [Feature Selection and Feature Extraction in Machine Learning: An Overview](https://medium.com/@mehulved1503/feature-selection-and-feature-extraction-in-machine-learning-an-overview-57891c595e96)
