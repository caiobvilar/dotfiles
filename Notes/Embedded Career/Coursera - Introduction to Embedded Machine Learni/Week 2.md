# Week 2
## Neural Networks and Training

While optional, we encourage you to take a look at the following articles and videos to learn more about the topics covered in this lesson:

Another introduction to neural networks, if you'd like another perspective: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) 

Here is a full (1+ hour) lecture on how neural networks work with forward- and backpropagation. It is a real deep dive and includes the calculus necessary for backpropagation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d14TUNcbn1k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d14TUNcbn1k)
