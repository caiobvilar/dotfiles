# Isometric Sound/Frequency Based Hack-N-Slash

+ The hero has some guns and they emit a soundwave on some bandwiths per gun or gun type
	+ The output wave's color is according to the frequency;
+ The surfaces/monsters act like low-pass, high-pass, bandpass or any other filter
+ The hero must adjust the gun's output to reach the natural frequency of the enemy/obstacle to break it and solve puzzles.
