## Exercise 1.1
You have a 5k resistor and a 10k resistor. What is their combined resistance (a) in series and (b) in parallel?
- Series:
	- $$R = 5k+10k = 15k \Omega$$
- Parallel:
	- $$R = \frac{5k*10k}{5k+10k} = 3.33k\Omega$$

## Exercise 1.2
If you place a 1 ohm resistor across a 12V car battery, how much power will it dissipate?
 - $$P = V*I = V*\frac{V}{R} = \frac{V^2}{R} = \frac{12^2}{1} = 144 W$$
